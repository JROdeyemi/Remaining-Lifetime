This is me calculating how many days or months we have left to spend assuming the maximum age we can grow to is 90 years. 
As dark as this might be, it reminded me that there is never enough time and I have to appreciate every day I get to stay alive. 
With this project, I am more determined to be an excellent data engineer so I can make massive impact in my world before I'm 90. 
If you don't mind, head to https://replit.com/@Josimal360/Remaining-Lifetime#main.py and find out how many days, weeks and months you have before you're 90
